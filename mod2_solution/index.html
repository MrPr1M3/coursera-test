                    A grey hat is a computer hacker or computer security expert who may sometimes violate laws or typical ethical standards, but does not have the malicious intent typical of a black hat hacker. The term began to be used in the late 1990s, derived from the concepts of "white hat" and "black hat" hackers.

                    Black hat hackers are the stereotypical illegal hacking groups often portrayed in popular culture, and are "the epitome of all that the public fears in a computer criminal".[4] Black hat hackers break into secure networks to destroy, modify, or steal data, or to make the networks unusable for authorized network users.[5]
